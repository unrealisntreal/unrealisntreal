### Hi, i'm _Unreal_.

##### I'm a game developer and a self-diagnosed software engineer. You'll see me build applications with the least convinient tools ever. Why? Because I refuse to let go of Lua, my favorite programming language. It doesn't have support for a whole lot of stuff appart from its Roblox fork.
##### Anyways, I'll be sharing a few of my personal libraries on Github. My work will be completely MIT licensed because I love doing free labour. I'll have work done in Lua 5.1, Luau and C/Rust from time to time because why not.
